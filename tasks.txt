
1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer?

|
| dataset = load '/home/acadgild/petrol-dataset.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (did:chararray,dname:chararray,brate:chararray,srate:chararray,vin:int,vout:int,year:int);
|
| group_dataset = GROUP dataset BY dname;
|
| volume_dataset = FOREACH group_dataset GENERATE group as dname,SUM(dataset.vout) as totalvolume;
|
| DUMP volume_dataset;
|
|

2. Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of petrol sold in volume.

|
| dataset = load '/home/acadgild/petrol-dataset.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (did:chararray,dname:chararray,brate:chararray,srate:chararray,vin:int,vout:int,year:int);
|
| order_dataset = ORDER dataset BY vout desc;
|
| topten_dataset = LIMIT order_dataset 10;
|
| exact_dataset = FOREACH topten_dataset GENERATE did as distributor_id,vout as volume_of_petrol;
|
| DUMP exact_dataset;
|

3. List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

|
| dataset = load '/home/acadgild/petrol-dataset.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (did:chararray,dname:chararray,brate:chararray,srate:chararray,vin:int,vout:int,year:int);
|
| order_dataset = ORDER dataset BY vout desc;
|
| topten_dataset = LIMIT order_dataset 10;
|
| exact_dataset = FOREACH topten_dataset GENERATE did as distributor_id,year;
|
| DUMP exact_dataset;
|

4. Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.
